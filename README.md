# Habit Tracker app using Vite + React + TS + Redux Toolkit + MUI

## TODOs:

- add persistence while page refresh. Example: localStorage
- store habits in the database. Example: Sqlite
- edit a habit (title and frequency)
- show a message when there are no habits
- use a form library. React hook form or Tanstack form
- use form validation. Zod
- any Typescript improvements
- Authentication (login, logout, user dashboard, user settings)
- Authorisation (user vs admin roles and capabilities)
- probably add a graph
- any style improvements including animations
- showing fun images based on age?
